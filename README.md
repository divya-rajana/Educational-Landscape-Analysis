# Educational-Landscape-Analysis
Mapping the Educational Landscape is an end-to-end project, that provides an in-depth analysis of Indiaâ€™s engineering colleges using a combination of Python, SQL, and Power BI. The goal is to offer insights into various attributes of colleges, including fees, ownership, geographical distribution, and average ratings, among other key factors.

Project Components
Data Collection (Python Web Scraping): Python scripts are included to scrape data from publicly available sources. These scripts extract details on college names, locations, ownership types, ratings, course offerings, and fees.

Data Storage and Analysis (MySQL): SQL queries are used for data transformation and analysis, preparing the dataset for advanced insights and visualizations. The queries perform tasks such as creating a ranking model, estimating college rankings, and filtering data by various criteria.

Data File (Excel): The cleaned and processed data file, available in Excel format, serves as a base for the Power BI dashboard.

Power BI Dashboard: An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes the data, presenting insights on college distribution by zone and state, comparison of fees between government and private institutions, average ratings by zone, and more. The dashboard enables users to filter data by zone, state, ownership type, fees, and ratings.
